# VR Transoformation of classic and modern Theatre 
## master thesis

In this work I will attempt to transform different theatre performances into VR experiences, adding something, subtracting other things and thus creating something new.

The idea is not to simply offer a virtual stage for a past performance, but rather to emphasize what is added and taken in the virtual space and try to 
make these things more visible. Playing with the boundaries of theatre definitions, this work will attempt to newly conceptualize theatre theories in a virtual world.
