Release 1.6

Bug Fixes:
Save grabbable rigidbody state only on the first grab of a two handed grab
Prevent rigidbody warning when restoring kinematic grabbable state
Line of sight check ignored when grabbing a force grabbed object
Handled Destroyed "Hovered Grabbables"
Center Of Mass, Inertia Tensor, and Inertia Tensor Rotation are returned to their pregrab state on release 
	instead of being recalculated which wipes out custom overrides
Fixed hand popping to the socket when placing due to joint destruction timing

Grab Updates:


New Line grab - create one grabpoint and pose with a start / end point and grab 
	anywhere on the axis (position and rotation), currently limited to Up axis of the hand. 
	Grabbing only with trigger frees the hand to move or rotate until grip is pressed again.
	Requires ParentHandModel = false.

New "MoveGrab" behaviour for the hand when grabbing. The hand will move to the grabbable and rotate into position instead of pulling
	the grabbable to the hand. This automatically happens for grabbables marked stationary or if the object is already grabbed.
	Experimental "HandGrabs" option is added to the HVRHandGrabber to enable this for all static posed grabs.
		
CloneHandModel defaulted to true on the Hand Prefabs, automatically clones the hand model and removes the colliders from the clone,
	the clone is used when parenting the hand to the grabbable instead of the original. This prevents inertia tensor and center of mass
	changes to the object from the addition of the hand colliders. This is also necessary for the hand rigidbody when performing a "MoveGrab" 
	which requires collisions of the hand to be temporarily disabled which triggers inertia and com recalculation. Alternatively the hand
	rigidbody can have it's COM and tensor overriden so that it cannot recalculate itself.

New GrabIndicator GameObject field on the Hand Grabber, if provided it will enabled and position itself at the grab point location 
	when hovering a grabbable. 

New ForcePull style added to the Force Grabber that uses physics forces, separate settings than Gravity Glove style

New IsJointAnchor field on the GrabPoint (defaulted false), the GrabPoint position will become the joint anchor instead of the palm of the hand,
	useful to stabilize the joint for objects that might be held by the finger tips instead of in the palm.
	
Parenting of the hand is now longer required for non stationary physics joint grabs that don't have joint offsets (WIP).
	Parenting still recommended for static stationary objects, like levers, drawers, handles etc.
	
HVRGrabbable:EnableInvisibleHand set false by default
Added hover haptics to distance grab
Grabbing from a socket now uses the "Primary GrabPoint" (ForceGrabberGrabPoint)
Kinematic Grabbables remain kinematic by default - if you unpacked the example back pack, disable kinematic as it was previously enabled in the prefab
Trigger grab option added to HVRPlayerInputs. When using Toggle grab mode the Trigger can only grab - not drop.
Gravity Glove style adds AutoGrabDistance, "auto grab" trigger grabbable bag removed.


Knuckles Update:
Added GripUseEither to HVRInputSettings - useful to use the GripForce Steambinding in addition to the Steam Grip Button action.
	This will allow your player to grab objects with just pinky, ring, or middle finger pressure;
Knuckles bindings updated to bind GripForce to the grip action.


Fixed Grab Joint Changes:
Fixed joints now create Locked axis Configurable Joints to simplify the jointing process
Grabbable Fixed Joint Settings [CanJointBreak, JointBreakForce, JointBreakTorque] are now deprecated and will be removed in the next update. 
Use JointOverride on the grabbable to set any break forces, they are infinity by default and will not break

Physics hand changes:
Legacy Joint Settings (pre 1.5) on the HVRJointHand component are now removed. JointSettings must be assigned now.

Pun Updates:
Pun Rig updated with recent additions and changes to hand and grabbable joint updates
Dynamic pose now works with CloneHandModel
Dynamic pose should work with not parenting

Release 1.53

Bug Fixes:
Fixed dynamic grab failing to create the final grab joint due to a rotation calculation error

Major Physics Hands Update:
Hand default mass has been set to 2, (5 is too high)
Hand default strength has been adjusted to reflect changes in the physics hand system
Hand max velocity removed as it isn't necessary, hand strength settings should be used instead.
Two hand grabs are much more stable with the physics hand updates
Updated the default hand prefab with COM and Inertia overrides to account for the capsules colliders on the fingers
which causes bad rotation correction and unexpected recoil directions
Hands can now keep up with the player even at high speeds.

CollisionDetection field added to change the mode while held, defaulted to ContinuousDynamic
Removed the temporary joint override function, custom hand strengths and grabbable mass adjustments should be used instead

Release 1.52

Bug Fixes:
Fixed the dynamic grab having rotation issues after grabbing

Enhancements:

Added Clone Hand model option to the hand grabber that will clone the hand model and remove any colliders,
	if enabled the cloned hand model will be parented to the object instead of the original which stabilizes the rigidbody
	due to the rigidbody resetting it's properties with newly added colliders.
New HVRRigidBodyOverrides component that lets you override Center Of Mass, Inertia Tensor, and Inertia Tensor Rotation
Added grabbable inspector toggle to draw renderer bounding box and center of mass
Added HandGrabbed and HandReleased events to the Grabbable component
